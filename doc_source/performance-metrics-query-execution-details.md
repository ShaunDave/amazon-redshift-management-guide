# Viewing query details<a name="performance-metrics-query-execution-details"></a>

You can analyze query details on the Amazon Redshift console\. With a query identifier, you can view details of a query\. Details can include, for example, the query's completion status, duration, SQL statement and whether it's a user query or one that was rewritten by Amazon Redshift\. A *user query* is a query that is submitted to Amazon Redshift, either from an SQL client or generated by a business intelligence tool\. Amazon Redshift might rewrite the query to optimize it, and this can result in multiple rewritten queries\. Although the process is done by Amazon Redshift, you see the rewritten queries on the query details page along with the user query\. 

**To view a query**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Queries and loads** to display the list of queries for your account\. You might need to change settings on this page to find your query\. 

1. Choose the **Query** identifier in the list to display **Query details**\. 

   The **Query details** page includes **Query details** and **Query plan** tabs with metrics about the query\. 

   Metrics include details about a query such as start time, query ID, status, and duration\. Other details include whether a query ran on a main cluster or a concurrency scaling cluster, and if it's a parent or rewritten query\.
