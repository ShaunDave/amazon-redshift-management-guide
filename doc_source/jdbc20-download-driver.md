If you use the Amazon Redshift JDBC driver for database authentication, make sure that you have AWS SDK for Java 1\.11\.118 or later in your Java class path\. If you don't have AWS SDK for Java installed, download the ZIP file with JDBC 4\.2窶田ompatible driver \(without the AWS SDK\) and driver dependent libraries for the AWS SDK:

  This ZIP file contains the JDBC 4\.2窶田ompatible driver \(without the AWS SDK\) and its dependent library files\. Unzip the dependent jar files to the same location as the JDBC driver\.
