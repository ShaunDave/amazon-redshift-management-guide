# Comparing Amazon Redshift Serverless to a provisioned cluster<a name="serverless-console-comparison"></a>

The following list describes features and behavior in Amazon Redshift Serverless and explains how it differs from a provisioned cluster\.
+ *A cluster vs a workgroup and namespace* \- Amazon Redshift Serverless doesn't have the concept of a cluster\. Instead, you have a workgroup, which contains the compute resources available to process workloads, and the namespace, which contains the associated database resources, snapshots, encryption keys, and users\.
+ *Node types* \- When you work with Amazon Redshift Serverless, you don't choose node types or specify node count like you do with a provisioned Amazon Redshift cluster\. Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions and manages capacity for you\. You can optionally specify base data warehouse capacity to select the right price/performance balance for your workloads\. You can also specify maximum RPU hours to set cost controls to ensure that costs are predictable\. For more information, see [Understanding Amazon Redshift Serverless capacity](serverless-capacity.md#serverless-rpu-capacity)\.
+ *Workload management and concurrency scaling* \- With a provisioned cluster, you enable concurrency scaling on your cluster to handle periods of heavy load\. Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically manages resources efficiently and scales, based on workloads, within the thresholds of cost controls\.
+ *Port* \- With a provisioned cluster, you can choose any port to connect\. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, your port, 5439, is static\.
+ *Resizing* \- With a provisioned cluster, you perform a cluster resize to add nodes or remove nodes\. Resizing is not applicable in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. You can however change the base data warehouse RPU capacity, based on your price and performance requirements\.
+ *Pausing and resuming* \- With a provisioned cluster, you pause and resume your cluster manually, based on an assessment of your workload at various times\. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, you pay only when queries are run, so there is no need to pause or resume\.
+ *Spectrum queries* \- With a provisioned cluster, Amazon Redshift Spectrum capacity exists on separate servers that are queried from the Amazon Redshift cluster\. Billing accrues if compute resources aren't idle\. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, billing accrues as Redshift Spectrum data is queried, like any other transaction\. \(Where data is queried from doesn't affect billing\. The metric is whether compute resources are processing SQL workloads\.\)
+ *Compute\-resource billing* \- With a provisioned cluster, billing occurs per second when compute resources aren't idle\. Specifically, when cluster nodes aren't paused\. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, you pay for the workloads you run, in RPU\-hours on a per\-second basis, with a 60\-second minimum charge\. This includes queries that access data in open file formats in Amazon S3\.
+ *Maintenance window* \- With a provisioned cluster, you specify a maintenance window when patching occurs on your cluster\. \(Typically, you choose a recurring time when use is low\.\) With Amazon Redshift Serverless, there is no maintenance window\. The system handles patching seamlessly\.
+ *Encryption* \- A provisioned cluster's data can be encrypted or unencrypted with AWS KMS \(with AWS managed or customer managed keys\)\. Amazon Redshift Serverless is always encrypted with AWS KMS, with AWS managed or customer managed keys\.
+ *Storage billing* \- Storage is billed apart from compute resources for a provisioned cluster with RA3 nodes, and for Amazon Redshift Serverless\. The rate is calculated according to GB per month\.
+ *User management* \- For both a provisioned cluster and for Amazon Redshift Serverless, users are IAM or Redshift users\. For information regarding setting up users and roles, see [Overview of managing access permissions to your Amazon Redshift resources](redshift-iam-access-control-overview.md)\.
+ *JDBC and ODBC tools and compatibility* \- Both provisioned clusters and Amazon Redshift Serverless are compatible with any JDBC or ODBC compliant tool or client application\. For more information about drivers, see [ Configuring connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configuring-connections.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.\.
+ *Requirement for credentials on sign in* \- Access to Amazon Redshift requires user name and password credentials, from an IAM user with specific permissions, for a provisioned cluster\. \(You can also associate a user to an IAM role\.\) Once authenticated, the user can connect seamlessly to the database, to the Redshift console, and to query editor v2\. For Amazon Redshift Serverless, you don't have to enter credentials in every instance\. For more information, see [Connecting to Amazon Redshift Serverless](serverless-connecting.md#serverless-connecting-endpoint)\. 
+ *Data API* \- Both provisioned clusters and Amazon Redshift Serverless support the Amazon Redshift Data API\. One difference is that with Amazon Redshift Serverless, you use the `workgroup-name` parameter instead of the `cluster-identity` parameter when you run a command\. For more information about calling the Data API, see [Using the Amazon Redshift Data API](data-api.md)\.
+ *Snapshots* \- Provisioned clusters support snapshots\. Amazon Redshift Serverless supports snapshots and recovery points\. For more information about snapshots and recovery points for a namespace, see [Working with snapshots and recovery points](serverless-snapshots-recovery.md)\.
+ *Data Sharing* \- Provisioned clusters support cross database, cross account, cross\-Region, and AWS Data Exchange data sharing\. Amazon Redshift Serverless supports all of the data sharing features that provisioned clusters do, and it also supports data sharing between Amazon Redshift Serverless and a provisioned cluster, tool, or client application\. For more information about using data sharing with other tools, see [ Integrating Amazon Redshift data sharing with business intelligence tools ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/tool-integration.html)\.
+ *Tracks* \- Provisioned clusters support switching between current and trailing tracks\. Amazon Redshift Serverless has no concept of a track\.
+ *System tables and views* \- Provisioned clusters support the existing set of system tables and views for cluster monitoring and other tasks that require system metadata\. Amazon Redshift Serverless supports new system tables and views\. For more information about system tables, see [Monitoring views](serverless-monitoring.md#serverless_views-monitoring)\.
+ *Parameter groups* \- Provisioned clusters support parameter groups\. Amazon Redshift Serverless does not have the concept of a parameter group\. For more information about parameter groups for a provisioned cluster, see [Amazon Redshift parameter groups](working-with-parameter-groups.md)\.
+ *Query monitoring* \- Query monitoring in provisioned clusters does not show all data in system tables\. Query monitoring in Amazon Redshift Serverless requires users to connect to the database to use system tables\. Thus, query monitoring and system tables are in sync\. Queries of system tables in Amazon Redshift Serverless use the database user mapped to the IAM user for using query monitoring\. For additional operators, the administrator must manually grant the `sys:operator` role to the database user\. 
+  *Audit logging* \- With Amazon Redshift Serverless, CloudWatch is a destination for audit logs\. However, for a provisioned cluster, Amazon S3\-based audit log delivery has been the norm\. Now, delivery of audit logs to CloudWatch is extended to cover provisioned clusters as well\. Amazon S3 based audit log delivery is not supported for Amazon Redshift Serverless\. 
+  *Event notifications* \- Amazon Redshift Serverless uses Amazon EventBridge to manage event notifications to keep you up\-to\-date regarding changes in your data warehouse\. Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that you can use to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources\.
