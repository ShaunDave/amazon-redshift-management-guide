# Data protection in Amazon Redshift<a name="security-data-protection"></a>

Amazon Redshift protects data at rest through encryption\. Optionally, you can protect all data stored on disks within a cluster and all backups in Amazon S3 with Advanced Encryption Standard AES\-256\. For more information, see [Amazon Redshift database encryption](working-with-db-encryption.md)\. 

If you require FIPS 140\-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint\. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS\) 140\-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/)\.
