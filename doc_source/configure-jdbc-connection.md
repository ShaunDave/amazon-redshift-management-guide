# Configure a JDBC Connection<a name="configure-jdbc-connection"></a>

You can use a JDBC connection to connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster from many third\-party SQL client tools\. To do this, you need to download a JDBC driver\. Follow the steps in this section if you want to use a JDBC connection\.

## Download the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver<a name="download-jdbc-driver"></a>

Amazon Redshift offers drivers for tools that are compatible with either the JDBC 4\.2 API, JDBC 4\.1 API, or JDBC 4\.0 API\. For information about the functionality supported by these drivers, go to the [Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver Release Notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.41.1065/Amazon+Redshift+JDBC+Driver+Release+Notes.pdf)\.  

For installation and configuration information, see [Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver Installation and Configuration Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.41.1065/Amazon+Redshift+JDBC+Driver+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

JDBC drivers version 1\.2\.27\.1051 and later support Amazon Redshift stored procedures\. For more information, see [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide Creating Stored Procedures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/stored-procedure-overview.html)\.

JDBC drivers version 1\.2\.8\.1005 and later support database authentication using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) credentials or identity provider \(IdP\) credentials\. For more information, see [Using IAM Authentication to Generate Database User Credentials](generating-user-credentials.md)\.

If you use the Amazon Redshift JDBC driver for database authentication, you must have AWS SDK for Java 1\.11\.118 or later in your Java class path\. If you don't have AWS SDK for Java installed, you can use a driver that includes the AWS SDK\. For more information, see [Previous JDBC Driver Versions With the AWS SDK for Java](jdbc-previous-versions.md#jdbc-previous-versions-with-sdk)

**Important**  
We strongly recommend using an Amazon Redshift JDBC driver that doesn't include the AWS SDK if possible\. The drivers in the following list don't include the AWS SDK\.

Download one of the following, depending on the version of the JDBC API that your SQL client tool or application uses\. If you're not sure, download the latest version of the JDBC 4\.2 API driver\.

**Note**  
For driver class name, use either com\.amazon\.redshift\.jdbc\.Driver or the version\-specific class name listed with the driver in the list following\.
+ JDBC 4\.2–compatible driver: [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/redshift\-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1\.2\.41\.1065/RedshiftJDBC42\-no\-awssdk\-1\.2\.41\.1065\.jar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.41.1065/RedshiftJDBC42-no-awssdk-1.2.41.1065.jar)\. 

  The class name for this driver is `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver`\.
+  JDBC 4\.1–compatible driver: [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/redshift\-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1\.2\.41\.1065/RedshiftJDBC41\-no\-awssdk\-1\.2\.41\.1065\.jar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.41.1065/RedshiftJDBC41-no-awssdk-1.2.41.1065.jar)\. 

  The class name for this driver is `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc41.Driver`\.
+  JDBC 4\.0–compatible driver: [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/redshift\-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1\.2\.41\.1065/RedshiftJDBC4\-no\-awssdk\-1\.2\.41\.1065\.jar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.41.1065/RedshiftJDBC4-no-awssdk-1.2.41.1065.jar)\. 

  The class name for this driver is `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc4.Driver`\.

Then download and review the [Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver License Agreement](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/Amazon+Redshift+JDBC+Driver+License+Agreement.pdf)\. 

If your tool requires a specific previous version of a driver, see [Previous JDBC Driver Versions](jdbc-previous-versions.md)\.

If you need to distribute these drivers to your customers or other third parties, please send email to *redshift\-pm@amazon\.com* to arrange an appropriate license\. 

## Obtain the JDBC URL<a name="obtain-jdbc-url"></a>

Before you can connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster from a SQL client tool, you need to know the JDBC URL of your cluster\. The JDBC URL has the following format: 

jdbc:redshift://*endpoint*:*port*/*database*

**Note**  
A JDBC URL specified with the former format of jdbc:postgresql://*endpoint*:*port*/*database* will still work\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html)

The following is an example JDBC URL: `jdbc:redshift://examplecluster.abc123xyz789.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev` 

For information about how to get your JDBC connection, see [Finding Your Cluster Connection String](configuring-connections.md#connecting-connection-string)\. 

 If the client computer fails to connect to the database, you can troubleshoot possible issues\. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Connection Issues in Amazon Redshift](troubleshooting-connections.md)\.
